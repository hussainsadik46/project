    <a>Welcome to Our Git Hub</a>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes. It tracks changes in source code during software development, enabling collaboration and efficient management of codebases.</p>
    <p>With Git, developers can create branches to experiment with new features, merge changes from different branches, and revert to previous versions of the code if needed. It also provides tools for resolving conflicts that may arise when multiple developers make changes to the same files.</p>
    <p>Git is widely used in the software development industry and is the backbone of popular</p>
    <p>platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, which offer hosting services for Git repositories along with additional collaboration features.</p>
